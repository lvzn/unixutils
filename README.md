# unixutils
This repo our implementation of a few unix utilities:
- cat
- grep
## Compiling
To compile the files type `make` in your unix shell
## Usage
### my-cat
To use the program, run `./my-cat filename.txt` in your unix shell in the root of the folder. If multiple filenames are passed (e.g. `./my-cat filename1.txt filename2.txt filename3.txt`), the program will read them all in order, one by one. Filenames are separated with space.
### my-grep
